	→ 1k - 2M+ users.

	Some other things to consider:
	→ Site needs to be responsive.
	→ We don't require very complex UI/UX (something academic).
	→ We need good ratio cost/performance while moving to production.
	Since awarded freelancer needs to complete the task until production.
	→ About delay, we have a big tolerance.(we can go up to months).
	→ You can use any Technology for website building and database.
	
	
The most important Functionalities & Features (unsorted)
	 Searching courses: dropdowns method (+ if ok we can add a query search)
	 In search page we tell user if his specialization is not found to go to adding a specialization
	(registered users + staff only), if it is not from staff team the info he added needs to be approved
	We’ll have 4 dropdowns where user can suggest to add a new value.
	 Ability to report course (uploaded file)
	 Results in multiple pages (limiting results)
	 Login/registration & mail confirmation
	 Upload
	 Collections
	 User can set specific url “Site.com/mycollection01” for his collection and be able to share it.
	 Managing (add-remove-modify) courses & collections (registered only)
	 Profile management
	 Message send / inbox
	 Right to left and left to right responsive design
	 Anyone from staff team can write new page or write translation of a page (about, contact …etc.).
	 Staff can manage translation (for example a button which has text in English “GO” we need to
	translate it manually in website without using api or whatever)
	 Staff need to approve the following:
	o “Field of training – Faculty – Level – Specialization” changes.
	o Profile photo changes.
	 Design
	o colors: I recommend to use the colors used in the following colors (50/46/44/24/22/21)
	shown in this website: https://visme.co/blog/website-color-schemes/.
	o Avoid:
	 Lot of colors
	 Funny design (fonts …etc)
